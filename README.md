# Read carefully !
Last update : 4/29/2020 - v2.3.2

The screenshot are from different version of the bot, if you want to see the current features, I suggest you to join the discord server.

# Setting Up

- You will only require the token of the account you want to run this bot on, it's better if it's an alt as self-bots violate ToS and you can get banned. To grab your token visit [this page](https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial).
- For further configuration you'll need to start the bot and access localhost:3000

# This doesn't work ?

- If you want a proof that it really works; you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/cyCYg2L2Du0)
- No, the source code here isn't working, as I edited it to do so, you can still read it if you want to make sure it contains no virus or malware.
- I won't stole your token, I'm just a student who needs money to continue his project.
- The bot will still be updated and have new features.
